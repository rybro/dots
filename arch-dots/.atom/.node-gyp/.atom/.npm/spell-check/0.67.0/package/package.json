The Grammars config option is a list of scopes for which the package\nwill check for spelling errors.\n\nTo enable _Spell Check_ for your current file type: put your cursor in the file,\nopen the [Command Palette](https://github.com/atom/command-palette)\n(<kbd>cmd+shift+p</kbd>), and run the `Editor: Log Cursor Scope` command. This\nwill trigger a notification which will contain a list of scopes. The first scope\nthat's listed is the one you should add to the list of scopes in the settings\nfor the _Spell Check_ package. Here are some examples: `source.coffee`,\n`text.plain`, `text.html.basic`.\n\n## Changing the dictionary\n\nCurrently, only the English (US) dictionary is supported.
