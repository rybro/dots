These icons are customizable by installing a package that provides an `atom.file-icons` service.\n\nThe `atom.file-icons` service must provide the following methods:\n\n* `iconClassForPath(path)` - Returns a CSS class name to add to the file view\n* `onWillDeactivate` - An event that lets the tree view return to its default icon strategy\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/tree-view/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/tree-view#readme","_id":"tree-view@0.205.0","_shasum":"a39732bf780ba5ad1ab1717761b941013db42b07","_resolved":"file:../../../../d-11645-27477-1snehez/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../d-11645-27477-1snehez/package.tgz"}
